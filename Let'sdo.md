What to do:

Mix a tablespoon of borax into around 75ml of water in the first cup. Stir until it dissolves (this may take a while)
Mix a tablespoon of PVA glue with two tablespoons of water. Add some drops of food colouring. Stir well until well mixed.
Add one tablespoon of the borax solution to the glue mixture. Stir well and see the mixture turn to slime.
Leave the slime for 30seconds and then pick it up!
